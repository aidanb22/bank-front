Some general notes for the project to go ahead and realize for next ones to create!

1. Look for react third party packages instead of attempting to create everything, Chart.js is a great example however we can use ChatGPT to figure out other third party
packages that could be of use for creating apps.

2. Create a lot of comments to figure out what we are doing where! Even use AI to do this for us whenever we cannot

3. Start thinking about how we can transition from the backend he uses to one that we can use
